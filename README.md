# Introduction

This is a condensed version of resources and ideas that can be found on [https://morg.systems/58465ab9](https://morg.systems/58465ab9) . You should check out that website for a more detailed idea of what learning the language is going to look like, especially after some time going through these beginner resources. You can think of this as a rough roadmap for Japanese learning, with resources attached.

# Kana

The first thing you should do is learn kana. This is the “alphabet” of Japanese so to speak and consists of Hiragana and Katakana. You will need to learn both.

  

Guide to Hiragana: **[https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)**

  

Guide to Katakana: **[https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)**

You do not need to attain 100% accuracy or be able to instantly recognize them. You just need to know most of them, to a reasonable degree, to move on to the next step.

# Grammar and Vocabulary

As a beginner you need

  

-   A way to learn words and build a foundation in vocabulary  
      
    
-   A way to learn grammar and acquire awareness of the language structure
<br>

Your objective is to build enough of a foundation in these two aspects so that you can start immersing in content meant for native speakers. Even if you forget words or grammar points, you will at least have enough knowledge to know what you don't know and and be able to look it up or ask about it. 
<br>
<br>
You are also free to have a go at immersion at any point in time while building your foundation. When to take the leap is up to you.

<br>

## A way to learn words
  <br>

Below are a few options you can use to learn words with. 

Remember, language learning is a marathon not a race, and these are tools to help you learn the language, not actual language learning itself. Doing 100 new words does not mean you're learning the language.
  <br>
  

### Anki + Kaishi

Anki is a flashcard software which utilizes a Spaced-Repetition System (SRS). In essence, it will show you cards just before you forget them, in continuously longer intervals. It is also highly-customizable:

Kaishi, an Anki core deck that covers important vocabulary you are likely to see in media:

**[https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases)**

**Recommended Anki Settings:**
- 5-10 new cards a day (up to how much you personally want to do)
- 9999 maximum reviews/day  (this is so you have no review cap and can clear all reviews scheduled for the day)
- New/Review order: Show after reviews  
- Turn on FSRS 
- Click the optimize button every month or so

<br>

### Wanikani

A paid service meant to teach you vocabulary with a focus on kanji. Comes with it’s own in-built SRS system. The scheduling and lessons are all set in stone so you cannot customize anything.

<br>


### JPDB

A website that acts as both a dictionary and an Anki-like SRS flashcard app. It has vocabulary deck made from various Japanese media, focusing on helping you learn what you want to read or watch. There is some customizability but the developer has been steadily updating less and less. Also no real core decks to start out with for beginners (unless you want to port from Anki).

## A way to learn grammar
  <br>
Below are some options to learn grammar with. They all cover pretty much the same thing so it's ok to choose one. You can cross-reference articles or lessons if you feel like the explanations are lacking.

<br>

### Tae Kim

A very standard guide which doesn't overstay its welcome. Explains concepts with examples and reads like several articles put together.




**[https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar)**
  <br>


### Sakubi

A guide which doesn't believe that mastery of grammar comes from reading long winded textbook explanations. The goal of this guide is to speedrun through all the core grammar points to familiarise yourself with them.



**[https://sakubi.neocities.org/](https://sakubi.neocities.org/)**
  <br>



### Genki


Classic classroom textbook. While geared towards classroom learning, it is perfectly fine for independent learners too. It is recommended to skip the exercises and just go through the grammar

  

[**(https://bit.ly/3qa752M)]**

<br>

### Minna No Nihongo (MNN)

Similar to Genki but entirely in Japanese. Personally don't recommend it due to the higher barrier to entry and less than ideal lessons.

<br>


## Pitch Accent

Despite what people say, pitch is absolutely a core part of the language and while it's possible to get by without good pitch, it will make conversing with you significantly more difficult and unpleasant. 

As a beginner, doing about 10 hours of ear training for pitch accent early on in your learning process can help you save hundreds of hours of pain later on.

Start by doing the minimal pairs test on https://kotu.io/, this is to see if you are able to correctly perceive the pitch of words. The test has no actual end but a good benchmark is 100 questions, of which you should aim to get all of them correct. 

<br>

## Graded Readers

These are books or stories deliberately made to be accessible for beginners. The aim of these books are to introduce you more vocabulary and more complicated grammar structures with each level, slowly easing you into reading. 

While some people may find graded readers boring, they are a good stepping stone towards reading actual native content and also good practice for a beginner.
